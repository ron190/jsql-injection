[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jsql-injection/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/jsql-injection/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/jsql-injection/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
**jSQL Injection** is a lightweight application used to find database information from a distant server.

It is **free**, **open source** and **cross-platform** (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).

![Kali Linux logo](https://github.com/ron190/jsql-injection/raw/master/web/images/kali_favicon.png "Kali Linux logo") jSQL Injection is also part of the official penetration testing distribution [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/) and is included in other distributions like [Pentest Box](https://pentestbox.com/), [Parrot Security OS](https://www.parrotsec.org), [ArchStrike](https://archstrike.org/) or [BlackArch Linux](http://www.blackarch.org/).
